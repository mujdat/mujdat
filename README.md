### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is MÃ¼jdat Korkmaz, I'm a Full-Stack Developer based in Dresden, Germany.

I started my journey as a developer 10+ years ago with PHP and WordPress.

In addition to learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I use technologies or frameworks like TypeScript, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, TailwindCSS, NestJS, REST and GraphQL APIs on a daily basis. These tools allow me to work efficiently.

I look forward to the future with excitement, as the world of web development is ever-evolving. My aim is to stay up to date as much as I can.

If you're looking for a developer to bring your ideas to life, you're at the right place!

I also like creating electronic music, cycling and bouldering in my free time.
