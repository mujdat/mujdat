### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is MÃ¼jdat Korkmaz, I'm a Front-End Developer and I currently work at PHMU as well as a freelancer on the side, based in Dresden, Germany.

I started my journey as a developer with WordPress and it's still one of the main technologies I use to create websites and web applications. Besides WordPress and the fundamentals like HTML, CSS & JavaScript, I use technologies like TypeScript, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, TailwindCSS, SASS and GraphQL / REST APIs every day. I'm experienced in building dynamic, flexible, interactive and modern websites and web applications.
