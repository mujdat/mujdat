### Hello! 👋🏻

I’m Müjdat, a software developer, electronic music maker and cycling enthusiast based in Dresden, Germany.

I bring over 10 years of experience, and specialize in building modern, agile, and custom software solutions. My expertise includes technologies such as Vue.js, Nuxt.js, NestJS, Shopware, and TailwindCSS, and I work daily with TypeScript, REST, and GraphQL APIs to streamline development. I’m committed to staying up-to-date in the ever-evolving field of software development and am excited to bring unique ideas to life.

I'm currently building Velopacker — All-in-one Bikepacking and Touring Planner
